## Professional Summary

A versatile professional with 4 years of experience spanning the entire technical spectrum ‚Äì from cloud infrastructure setup to full-stack development. I specialize in LLM-First architectures, advanced RAG systems, and context engineering for building intelligent agents with LangChain/LangGraph.

In recent months, I've spearheaded comprehensive digital transformations, migrating spreadsheet-based operations to enterprise cloud-native infrastructures. This includes developing innovative RAG systems and diplomatic networking platforms.

**Key Technical Contributions:**
*   Architected and deployed robust, zero-to-cloud infrastructure (Hetzner, Docker, Coolify).
*   Developed CRM agent systems using GPT-5 Nano, achieving over 95% accuracy in responses.
*   Built complete suites of enterprise applications (Django, Vue.js, FastAPI), including financial platforms with self-healing architecture.
*   Implemented AI-powered address correction solutions, boosting geocoding accuracy from 60% to over 95%.

**Technical Expertise:** Python, LangChain/LangGraph/LangSmith, Claude Code, advanced MCPs (Context7, Playwright, Figma MCP), RAG/GraphRAG architectures with Supabase/Neo4j, containerized DevOps, and AI-powered creative production.

**Unique Value Proposition:** My legal background provides a structured approach to complex problem-solving. I am fluent in English with extensive international collaboration experience, and possess a proven ability to operate across the entire technical stack ‚Äì from bare-metal configuration to sophisticated AI architectures and final creative output.
